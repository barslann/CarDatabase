Dependency Injection
    DI makes classes loosely coupled.This means that the creation of client dependencies is separated from the client's behavior.
    which makes unit testing easier.

    There are different types of DI, for example, the following two types

    1. Constructor Injection
        Dependencies are passed to a client class constructor.
    2. Setter Injection
        Dependencies are provided through setters.

DI in Spring Boot
    Spring Boot scans your application classes and register classes with certain annotations (@Service, @Repository, @Controller) as Spring Beans.
    This beans can be injected using an @Autowired annotation


    Java provides @Resource anotation that can be used to inject resources!
