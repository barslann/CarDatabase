Dependency Injection
    DI makes classes loosely coupled.This means that the creation of client dependencies is separated from the client's behavior.
    which makes unit testing easier.

    There are different types of DI, for example, the following two types

    1. Constructor Injection
        Dependencies are passed to a client class constructor.
    2. Setter Injection
        Dependencies are provided through setters.

DI in Spring Boot
    Spring Boot scans your application classes and register classes with certain annotations (@Service, @Repository, @Controller) as Spring Beans.
    This beans can be injected using an @Autowired annotation


    Java provides @Resource anotation that can be used to inject resources!


Basics of ORM, JPA, and Hibernate
    ORM is a technique that allows you yo fetch from and manipulate a database by using an object-oriented programming paradigm!
    It relies on object-oriented concepts rather than database structure. It also makes development much faster and reduces the amount of source code.
    ORM is mostly independent of databases.


    JPA provides object-relational mapping for Java developers. The JPA entity is a Java class that presents the structure of a database table.
    The fields of an entity class present the columns of the database tables.


    Hibernate is the most popular JAVA-based JPA implementation, adn is used in Spring boot as a default.
